My name is Mabel Villalba Jiménez. I'm a Data Engineer, with experience as Python Developer, Data Scientist and Data Analyst.


I currently work as a Data Engineer at SEAT:CODE in projects related to Predictive Maintenance of welding spots using Machine Learning for the SEAT Factory in Martorell.

I have experience in building and maintaining software in Python, building CI/CD pipelines, implementing unit testing and code quality checks.
I also have experience with the AWS stack: Kinesis Data Streams, Lambda, s3, Glue, SageMaker, Athena, QuickSight, CloudFormation, CodeBuild, CodePipeline.

I have worked in areas related with Data Extraction, Processing and Retrieving, Data Analysis and Machine Learning (i.e. Quantitative Trading, Time Series, Model Optimization, Web Scraping, Statistical Analysis…)


In addition, I also worked as a Project Reviewer and Classroom Mentor for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), reviewing projects from several nanodegrees in areas like Data Analysis and Visualization, Deep Learning, Statistical Analysis and general Machine Learning.

- **Classroom Mentor**: guiding students from the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) and the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
- **Project Reviewer**: helping students from the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) and the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) as in projects related to Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistical Analysis and general Machine Learning.


I love contributing to Open Source projects like the Python libraries [Scikit-Learn](ttps://github.com/mabelvj/scikit-learn), for Machine Learning and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev), for data structure and data analysis. See the list of contributions in the [Open Source Contributions](pullrequests) section.


Also, I really enjoy trying to answer questions on Stackoverflow ([Stackoverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9051284/mabel-villalba)).
