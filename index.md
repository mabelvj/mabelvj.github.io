My name is Mabel Villalba Jiménez. I'm a Data Scientist and Python Developer.

I work as a freelancer in Machine Learning, Python and R projects, striving at giving clients the best and most accurate solution for their needs.

In addition, I spend my time working for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) as:

- **Classroom Mentor**: guiding students from the [Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009) and the [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
- **Project Reviewer**: helping students from the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) and the [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) as in projects related to Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Statistical Analysis and general Machine Learning.

I also love contributing to Open Source projects like [Scikit-Learn](ttps://github.com/mabelvj/scikit-learn), a Machine Learning module for Python and [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev). See the  list of contributions in the [pull requests](pullrequests) section.
